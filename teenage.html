<p>6 August 2024 is coming! (my birthday). I am becoming a teen now. I have already started content creation on my youtube channel! I've started working on many new projects and intrests.</p> 
<hr>
<p>Well, one of these is Telecomunication. Or how the internet and all type of comunication works. This includes MODEMS, routers, sattelite communication or TV, VOiP, servers, networks, protocols, Set Top Boxes, Satellite Dishes, ODU'S, Fiber Optics, Cables, phone lines, radios, cell towers, radio towers, antennas, ISPs, stealing (i mean reusing) peoples old satellite TV Dishes, dial-up, DSL, broadband, telegraph, bluetooth and lots of fun hardware and software. I started reusing old routers to make my own ISP! I made servers for my home network and wiretapped a phone line as well! In the future I will be downloading an image of the Earth DIRECTLY FROM A SATELLITE IN SPACE! I began experimenting with a very old radio and decided to pick up unusual AM RADIO (MW) or shortwawe (SW) signals. It was a bit crreepy but cool as heck! Old tech is just so fun! During this telecommunication job of mine I learnt a new skill which was to repair, install and wire telephone ports around the house. This helps you learn how to deal with electrical jobs and how to do simple technician jobs yourself. You can learn to wire power outlets, coaxial outlets and ethernet ports around the house as well! Telephone ports are a great way to start as they operate at a low voltage and are generally safe to tinker around with.</p>

<p>You may want to ask me, what's your opinion on reading books? They are very fun to read and sometimes I go so deep that nobody can distract me. They are an awesome way to increase the sense of your imagination! I don't like those non interesting and boring Shakesphere books though. I don't even like the avengers books that people fall for. So my preferance of authors are: 1. Roald Dahl 2. Jeff Kinney 3. Enid Blyton 4. Sudha Murthy 5. Liz Pichon. The best books of these authors are: Danny the champion of the world; Diary of a wimpy kid; The Barney Mysteries; Grandma's bag of stories and Tom Gates respectively. They are awesome for kids to read and understand and do not have complicated words like the books of Shakesphere; Jack London; etc. I strongly recommend you all to read these books. or series  </p>

<p>Well, let's get my musitian skills out! Well Im good at playing the keyboard. (not the best at it) I know a few songs to pay and I manage to play them quite fluently. The cool thing is that I learnt this new skill completely from school! It's a skill not many people know and I do and thats why I'm special! Once agin I'm not an absolute gigachad at it but I'm quite good at doing it. I play generally Casio and Yamaha keyboards.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, I'm extremely good at chess. Like I'm almost unbeatable with my friends who know how to play chess very well. I used to do chess classes when I was very young and even if I play chess very rarely, I can still beat very good players. I like indoor games like chess, business, ludo, plot 4, Jenga and much more. I've built a new hobby which is to build dominoes. I love to watch them topple over one by one and making a satisfying sound. It requires a very stable hand. It takes hours to create and a second to destroy. You know what they say, "the urge to destroy is actually a creative urge." I've made my own awesome tricks. You can watch my domino compiliations on my YouTube channel!</p>
<hr>
<p>I am a gamer as well! I love to play and try out new games or retro games from the windows XP OR 2000 era on virtual machines. This includes games like DOOM, MicroSoft Cheese Terminator, Spce Pinball, Purble Place ect. Old tech is so fun! Virtual machines allow you to experiment with old operating syatems. I have tried out all Windows OS's and Mac OS 10 sterting from win 1.0 to win 11!. I also like to play Minecraft! So you may say I have a 5% gamer inside of me!
<hr>
<p>I love to stress test my old EliteBook 8570W form 2012. Its old but its so good that it can run minecraft with heavy shaders and have no lag with exploding items such as TNT. I have tried to crash and freeze multiple times but i could not do it whatsoever. Old is really Gold! I also used a GPU stress test using HeavyLoad appication but it could not even do a slight scratch on my beast laptop. The GPU is a Nvidia Quadro K2000M form 1st June 2012!!! Old tech is so fun. You never know what surprises it has. Its even faster than all mordern laptops I have in my home! I got 200 FPS!
<hr>
<p>I started my own Space Program.(Kind of) So..... I bought some firework rockets and then modified their rocket motors by attaching multiple boosters, bombs, and stages. I even made a cargo rocket to sent a toy red Tesla in the sky! It was so fun! But I had to shut down the space program becuz I ran out of rocket motors. HEHE :)

<p>I finally learnt how to drive a scooter! This may not be special to you but learning how to drive a scooter at the age of 12 is legit a very big deal! I can't drive outside of my society cuz I do not have a driving licence. But the fact i know how to drive a scooter is cool!</p>

<p>I am now learning how to use blender! Nah I'm not taling about the cooking blender. Im talking about an app that can make 3D Animations, models, awesome 3D art! Honestly, blender is kind of complicated not gonna lie. I am honestly shocked how my GPU can handle blender cuz blender is a GPU intensive application and my GPU is from 2012! Blender is an awesome skill to learn and you must try it too!!!</p>
<hr>
<p>I know MS-DOS, Python, bit of Java, Scratch, Linux hacking, Command prompt, and HTML. I decided to learn another programming language known as QBasic. I know I know it's kinda outdated but its still a cool thing to learn in 2024. Not gonna lie it's so easy that it only took my 2 days to learn almost the whole thing</p>
