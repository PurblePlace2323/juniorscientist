<p>6 August 2024 is coming! (my birthday). I am becoming a teen now. I have already started content creation on my youtube channel! I've started working on many new projects and intrests.</p> 
<p>Well, one of these is Telecomunication. Or how the internet and all type of comunication works. This includes MODEMS, routers, sattelite communication or TV, VOiP, servers, networks, protocols, Set Top Boxes, Satellite Dishes, ODU'S, Fiber Optics, Cables, phone lines, radios, cell towers, radio towers, antennas, ISPs, stealing (i mean reusing) peoples old satellite TV Dishes and lots of fun hardware and software. I started reusing old routers to make my own ISP! I made servers for my home nework and wiretapped a phone line as well! In the future I will be downloading an image of the Earth DIRECTLY FROM A SATELLITE IN SPACE! I begen experimenting with a very old radio and decided to pick up unusual AM RADIO (MW) or shortwawe (SW) signals. It was a bit crreepy but cool as heck! Old tech is just so fun!</p>
<p>You may want to ask me, what's your opinion on reading books? They are very fun to read and sometimes I go so deep that nobody can distract me. They are an awesome way to increase the sense of your imagination! I don't like those non interesting and boring Shakesphere books though. I don't even like the avengers books that people fall for. So my preferance of authors are: 1. Roald Dahl 2. Jeff Kinney 3. Enid Blyton 4. Sudha Murthy 5. Liz Pichon. The best books of these authors are: Danny the champion of the world; Diary of a wimpy kid; The Barney Mysteries; Grandma's bag of stories and Tom Gates respectively. They are awesome for kids to read and understand and do not have complicated words like the books of Shakesphere; Jack London; etc. I strongly recommend you all to read these books. or series  </p>
