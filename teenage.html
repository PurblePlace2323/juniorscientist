<p>6 August 2024 is coming! (my birthday). I am becoming a teen now. I have already started content creation on my youtube channel! I've started working on many new projects and intrests.</p> 
<hr>
<p>Well, one of these is Telecomunication. Or how the internet and all type of comunication works. This includes MODEMS, routers, sattelite communication or TV, VOiP, servers, networks, protocols, Set Top Boxes, Satellite Dishes, ODU'S, Fiber Optics, Cables, phone lines, radios, cell towers, radio towers, antennas, ISPs, stealing (i mean reusing) peoples old satellite TV Dishes, dial-up, DSL, broadband, telegraph, bluetooth and lots of fun hardware and software. I started reusing old routers to make my own ISP! I made servers for my home network and wiretapped a phone line as well! In the future I will be downloading an image of the Earth DIRECTLY FROM A SATELLITE IN SPACE! I began experimenting with a very old radio and decided to pick up unusual AM RADIO (MW) or shortwawe (SW) signals. It was a bit crreepy but cool as heck! Old tech is just so fun! During this telecommunication job of mine I learnt a new skill which was to repair, install and wire telephone ports around the house. This helps you learn how to deal with electrical jobs and how to do simple technician jobs yourself. You can learn to wire power outlets, coaxial outlets and ethernet ports around the house as well! Telephone ports are a great way to start as they operate at a low voltage and are generally safe to tinker around with.</p>
<hr>
<p>You may want to ask me, what's your opinion on reading books? They are very fun to read and sometimes I go so deep that nobody can distract me. They are an awesome way to increase the sense of your imagination! I don't like those non interesting and boring Shakesphere books though. I don't even like the avengers books that people fall for. So my preferance of authors are: 1. Roald Dahl 2. Jeff Kinney 3. Enid Blyton 4. Sudha Murthy 5. Liz Pichon. The best books of these authors are: Danny the champion of the world; Diary of a wimpy kid; The Barney Mysteries; Grandma's bag of stories and Tom Gates respectively. They are awesome for kids to read and understand and do not have complicated words like the books of Shakesphere; Jack London; etc. I strongly recommend you all to read these books. or series  </p>
<hr>
<p>Well, let's get my musitian skills out! Well Im good at playing the keyboard. (not the best at it) I know a few songs to pay and I manage to play them quite fluently. The cool thing is that I learnt this new skill completely from school! It's a skill not many people know and I do and thats why I'm special! Once agin I'm not an absolute gigachad at it but I'm quite good at doing it. I play generally Casio and Yamaha keyboards.</p>
<hr>
<p>Well, I'm extremely good at chess. Like I'm almost unbeatable with my friends who know how to play chess very well. I used to do chess classes when I was very young and even if I play chess very rarely, I can still beat very good players. I like indoor games like chess, business, ludo, plot 4, Jenga and much more. I've built a new hobby which is to build dominoes. I love to watch them topple over one by one and making a satisfying sound. It requires a very stable hand. It takes hours to create and a second to destroy. You know what they say, "the urge to destroy is actually a creative urge." I've made my own awesome tricks. You can watch my domino compiliations on my YouTube channel!</p>
<hr>
<p>I am a gamer as well! I love to play and try out new games or retro games from the windows XP OR 2000 era on virtual machines. This includes games like DOOM, MicroSoft Cheese Terminator, Spce Pinball, Purble Place ect. Old tech is so fun! Virtual machines allow you to experiment with old operating syatems. I have tried out all Windows OS's and Mac OS 10 sterting from win 1.0 to win 11!. I also like to play Minecraft! So you may say I have a 5% gamer inside of me!
<hr>
<p>I love to stress test my old EliteBook 8570W form 2012. Its old but its so good that it can run minecraft with heavy shaders and have no lag with exploding items such as TNT. I have tried to crash and freeze multiple times but i could not do it whatsoever. Old is really Gold! I also used a GPU stress test using HeavyLoad appication but it could not even do a slight scratch on my beast laptop. The GPU is a Nvidia Quadro K2000M form 1st June 2012!!! Old tech is so fun. You never know what surprises it has. Its even faster than all mordern laptops I have in my home! I got 200 FPS!
<hr>
<p>I started my own Space Program.(Kind of) So..... I bought some firework rockets and then modified their rocket motors by attaching multiple boosters, bombs, and stages. I even made a cargo rocket to sent a toy red Tesla in the sky! It was so fun! But I had to shut down the space program becuz I ran out of rocket motors. HEHE :)

<p>I finally learnt how to drive a scooter! This may not be special to you but learning how to drive a scooter at the age of 12 is legit a very big deal! I can't drive outside of my society cuz I do not have a driving licence. But the fact i know how to drive a scooter is cool!</p>
<hr>
<p>I am now learning how to use blender! Nah I'm not taling about the cooking blender. Im talking about an app that can make 3D Animations, models, awesome 3D art! Honestly, blender is kind of complicated not gonna lie. I am honestly shocked how my GPU can handle blender cuz blender is a GPU intensive application and my GPU is from 2012! Blender is an awesome skill to learn and you must try it too!!!</p>
<hr>
<p>I know MS-DOS, Python, bit of Java, Scratch, Linux hacking, Command prompt, and HTML. I decided to learn another programming language known as QBasic. I know I know it's kinda outdated but its still a cool thing to learn in 2024. Not gonna lie it's so easy that it only took my 2 days to learn almost the whole thing</p>
<hr>
<p>So, as you know I LOVE old technology. So why not try running old versions of minecraft on a fricking windows XP laptop. Not going to lie, it was a pain in the ass. I had to install millions of drivers and I could only get it Half running. I learnt a LOT because I was always scared to install software like drivers cuz if u install the wrong one, your PC IS BRICKED AND WONT RUN. It was a very fun experience testing those old versions of the minecraft game. Old tech history is always fascinating!. Well since it was hard to find the Intel drivers for the OLD AF Intel atom, there was basically no open GL but did it mean no minecraft? NO! I was able to play minecraft through an App called ClassiCube which did allow me to play minecraft on the old windows XP laptop!</p>
<hr>
<p>Although I have documented every single experiment I ahve done till now in video form, now I am going to stop recording such videos. I don't have any time to document and edit these videos so everything I do, I am going to document it here on this website. It might be boring to read later on in my life but it is a better solution to save my time.</p>
<hr>
<p>So, here are some random lists I have that also document my life so.... if u want to read these, you can. Peace :)</p>

<p>Due to my affection for old tech i decided to jailbreak my old iPad mini from Apple that was sitting in my drawer since 2015. For the new folks here ill explain what jailbreaking an apple device means. Well as you know Apple devices are super stubborn and installing 3rd party apps or doing fun things like hacking or just playing games is almost impossible. In the early days of 2012, many folks used to 'jailbreak' their iDevices so they could install a 3rd party app store called Cydia. It was basically hacking back then. So it would allow these people to install themes, tweaks, apps and games on their iPhones that are not approved by Apple. I did the same on my iPad 2 which was running iOS 9.3.5. It took me 2 days but it was worth it and was very fun. I installed a lotta games and played them. finally i took my revenge against apple. I just hate apple not gonna lie. Jailbreaking is super fun and 'easy' to do. I was very satisfied at the end. Nowadays Apple devices are super hard to jailbreak but back in the day it only needed a windows laptop. I am definitely going to install a few more apps on my Jailbroken iPad and test them out. With the art of Jailbreaking, I was able to install Minecraft Pocket Editon on my iPad for free, which has been my dream to do. It was extremely hard as finding the files for such an old version of minecraft is impossible. I did it with a tool called sideloadly which I used to load the ipa files into my iPad with iTunes. It was so fun to play Minecraft on my 12 yr old iPad!</p>
<hr>
<p>Continuing my quest to exploit my apple iPad, I decided to dualboot iOS 6 on that old thing. So, basically, dualbooting is when you have 2 or more operating systems on the same device and you can run any of them at a time. So my iPad was running iOS 9.3.5 as the normal OS. It was so slow. Plus as you already know in mordern tech, the icons and design of products is getting simpler and more boring. So intalling iOS 6 completely changed that. I jailbroke the iPad then insalled iOS 6 using coolbooter and got to see the nostalgic premium glass icons of iOS 6. Yeah you won't get to see that anywhere nowadays. I runs so much faster and just delights me so much by its old charachteristic style. </p>
<hr>
<p>In my mission to violate every single policy in the Apple Terms and Conditions, I decided to reinstall some of my old games. I logged into my old Apple ID and intalled the last complatible versions of the games from the app store. Some worked while some did not. I got memories of playing temple run and talking tom back in the days. Why I decided to replenish these games is because people find no use for old iPad and forget their apple ID and the iPad just become e-waste. So by violating Apple policies, im saving the environment from e-waste kinda. Now I can finally play old games all day on the old iPad! After doing that, I just turned my iPad into a mini Windows 10 PC. Maybe Apple is soon gonna kill me XD.</p>
<hr>
<p>I had a super old Lenovo tablet with Android 5 on it. It was so old nothing worked. So to prevent it from becomine e-waste I installed the minecraft game on it, essentially turning it into a minecraft tablet!></p>
<hr>
<p>Now back to testing out old tech, I started experimenting with emulators for nintendo consoles. Emulators are softwares which allow you to mimic systems or hardware on another system. For example I emulated many consoles like the NES, SNES, 3DS, Game Cube, Wii, Wii U etc. on my windows computer. There are many games or ROMs which you can load into the console running on your device through the emulator to play that game. I emulated the console NES made by nintendo and played the original super mario bros on it. Emulators are so fun. They allow you to run ancient consoles on your computer and play the games that were designed to run on them, without you having to even have them! Old tech is so fun!!!</p>
<hr>
<p>In the modern age, to store your files you might use a Solid-State-Drive (SSD) or if you have an old PC, you might even use a Hard Disk Drive (HDD). OR if you are an office worker, you might even store you files in the cloud (servers) like Google Drive, DropBox etc. Well, back in the 2000s, you did not have these. Back then, there was mostly Optical Media and Magnetic media like Compact Disks and Floppy Disks to store your data. Nowadays nobody uses these. I had a lot A LOT of CD's at my home. Probably hundreds of them. Luckily I had a CD Drive to read the disks and it was a pain. The storage forms we use today are fast, but CD's and Floppy Disks are very very slow. There was a lot af fun data to read in those ancient disks like movies, documents, games and much more. Some of these had college documents, drivers, Operating Systems and so much stuff. It took like 5 minutes to load each disk. But for some reason, me trying this ancient technology, I felt nostalgia. I grew up watching my parents use these CD's to play movies. Let's just say that CD's and DVD's are dead and are never coming back. But I did have a lot of fun bringing this tech back to life!</p>
<hr>
<p>Randomly one day, while scrolling on YouTube Shorts, I discovered a channel called 'Paper Engines'. A guy made many working models of engines out of paper which is so amazing! I wanted to learn this skill so I also made 3 engines. To make one, you just stack a bunch of graph paper, cut the parts like pistons, crank shafts, gearboxes, connecting rods, flywheels and cylinders out and just stck all the layers together and finally assemble the engine. It is a very hard process to make a working, moving engine out of such thin paper. It took me 4 hours to make each engine. I made a Single cylinder engine and a V-Twin engine. It takes a lot of patience and skill to make one and I was happy I could learn this crafty piece of engineering. I also made a frickin turbocharger, an exaust, a flywheel, clutch, a whole functional transmission, a throttle valve, disk brake and a camshaft for my engines too!</p>
<hr>
<p>Now I stuck my head into the world of robotics with the Arduino UNO. Basically a mini computer you upload code to and make anything you want with sensors and stuff. I learnt how to do connections make sensor like knock sensors using piezo disk, make songs using buzzers, use IR and ultrasonic sensors, use bluetooth modules, make cool RGB lights with leds, use potentiometers, light sensors(ldr), servo motors, LCD Displays, thermistors, WiFi modules like ESP8266, relays, smoke sensors, mercury tilt switches, motor driver IC, optocouplers, flame sensors, moisture sensor, humidity sensor, pressure sensor, accelerometer, gyroscope, gravity sensor, 7-Segment Displays, RFID Modules, making darlinton pair audio amplifiers, AC voltage sensors, IR remote hackers, microphone noise sensor, ESP 8266 AM/FM RADIO Transmitter, Public internet WiFi Jammer and beacon attack which completely kill and destroys a router, a FULL BRiDGE RECTIFIER with diodes, heart rate monitor, GSR lie detector, pressure sensor, a multimeter, AM Crystal foxhole radio receiver, Lightning/static electricity detector, solenoids, metal detectors, Plant 'feeling' detector, ESP 8266 powered telegram social media chatbot, an ineffecient crypto bitcoin miner, wireless charger, home automation system that can be controlled from anywhere in the world from the cloud on firebase, a high voltage gererator with transformer driver circuit, a matrix display screen, an old school spark gap radio FM transmitter, a high voltage generator from inductor relay, a very low frequency radio receiver that can listen to the radio waves of the earth or submarines, a switch that turns on when it senses high voltage using coherer effect, logic gate CPU with tansistors, an induction heater that heats metal "wirelessly" using changing magnetic feilds and eddy currents and much more with arduino. I also learnt how to solder stuff! This Was my real start into the world of robotics and IoT.</p>
