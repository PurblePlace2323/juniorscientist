<p>6 August 2024 is coming! (my birthday). I am becoming a teen now. I have already started content creation on my youtube channel! I've started working on many new projects and intrests.</p> 
<p>Well, one of these is Telecomunication. Or how the internet and all type of comunication works. This includes MODEMS, routers, sattelite communication or TV, VOiP, servers, networks, protocols, Set Top Boxes, Satellite Dishes, ODU'S, Fiber Optics, Cables, phone lines, radios, cell towers, radio towers, antennas and lots of fun hardware and software. I started reusing old routers to make my own ISP! I made servers for my home nework and wiretapped a phone line as well! In the future I will be downloading an image of the Earth DIRECTLY FROM A SATELLITE IN SPACE! I begen experimenting with a very old radio and decided to pick up unusual AM RADIO (MW) or shortwawe (SW) signals. It was a bit crreepy but cool as heck! Old tech is just so fun!</p>
