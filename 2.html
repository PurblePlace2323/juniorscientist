<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify"><font color="3FA03E">From age 6 I always crafted something. Even it was trash. It used to teach me something. Till age 8 I used to make these gadgets of science. My mom was tired of cleaning them up. I had made so many of them that I filled up a whole container that is used to fill up grains. It was 1 meter by 500 cm!</font></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">At age 10 I used to do these experiments. I started off with chemistry. My father used to buy me these chemicals. He bought me hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, copper sulphate, and sodium acetate. These were safe experiments but some used to be dangerous. Like making chlorine gas an hydrogen in my balcony or make an oxygen bomb or make explosives.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify"><font color="3FA03E">When I used to get bored with chemistry, I used to do physics. I used to do these electrical experiments. I made robots, do experiments with nichrome wires (which my father bought), and so much more! like making a 3000 volt taser from a mosquito racket or making my own engines.</font></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify"> When I got bored wih physics, I used to do stargazing. I had this telescope (which my father bought for me). I used to look at the moon and look at the planets of the solar system through it. Boy it was fun!</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify"><font color="3FA03E">You guessed it! When I got bored again, I used to mess around with technology. I used to break apart things that don't work and harvest working parts from them. Like opening a headphone, washing machine and all sorts of stuff. I used to also make viruses with notepad in windows when I was at this age. I used to make virtual machines and experiment with operating systems from the time that I wasn't even born yet! I used to stress test computers and much more! I used to play retro games and get to know the history about them. I used to code my own games too! And I still make them today! I used to experiment with browsers and the list goes on till today! I know how to code in Scratch, Python, Microsoft Windows LOGO and HTML. Fun fact, this website is also made in HTML. I know how to use Linux and Windows terminals as well. They are Command Line intefaces where instead of using the computer with the mouse and different icons to navigate, you use only the keyboard and monitor. You need to type specific commands to do stuff. For example, Command Prompt; Windows Powershell and the Linux terminal. It was so fun! I am a whitehat hacker and I have hacked my own computers many times at the age of 11. When you are a hacker, you must never hack other people's stuff, or it is considered illegal. I do my hacking stuff on my the computers and other devices that I own. I like to test out games and how they work! I like to jailbreak AI and make it do things that violate its guidelines.</font></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">Now I'm 11 years old. I made this website at this age. I have a video recorded of all the experiments i've done till now. I'm now in 7th grade. I did not even leave the field of rocket science. I used to make parachutes like a NASA engineer and throw then off the 7th floor of my building with some friends.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify"><font color="3FA03E">For those who are wondering why I left biology behind, I've recently started experimenting with this too! I made plant pots and terrairiums and observed the behaviour of insects such as ants. From age 9 a had photos of all creatures I saw. When I was in fourth grade I even saw a monkey sitting in my balcony. It is confusing to see a wild animal in a huge city.</font></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">I've always been fascinated with science and I continue to explore it! I want to become an astronaut when I grow up.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify"><font color="3FA03E">I get quite sad when I lose my videos whle transferring or when somebody deletes them. I put them together and edit them with hard work.</font></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">I also from the start I used to edit my own videos without any help. I used the software Video.Guru to edit. I call myself a 'pro' at it. I also took intrest in photography like steel wool photography </p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify"><font color="3FA03E">So I also call myself as a multitalented scientist. No one con stop me from doing that. I hate people looking curiously at me when I'm just doing my own experiments and the pesky children who follow me everywhere to just check out what the hell I'm doing there. I am genuenly quite suprised that kids of my age still dont know many basic features of computers and they keep asking things that I know but they don't. One insident that happened is when I was just talking something about 'light pollution'. I am an astronomer and astrophotographer so of course I know about it. But even my teachers and my classmates never heard of it. They were like "How can light cause pollution?" and I just couldn't explain to them. </font></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">A fun fact about me is that I had a YouTube channel. It rocked 56 subscribers. I made vlogging and festive videos and unboxing videos as well. But YouTube soon knew that I was underaged and deleted my channel. I got international comments as well and my most viewed video was at 300 views. Those videos were beautifully edited by my sister. Thanks to her for the support. I hate YouTube so much for doing that.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify"><font color="3FA03E">So I have more hobbys than science. I love travelling and treking. I love to explore and love to spot sometthing new. I am  a huge foodie and love to cook. I experiment and make my own sandwitch and noodle recipies with cheese and other ingredients. It almost always turns out awesome! I just love food! I can't regret craving for food and I can say I love spicy. I am very very tolerant towards spicy food and I adore it. I just cannot live without it!</font></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">When I go to my farmhouse I feed and pet the animals. I love to swim in 7 meter deep and 5 meter wide wells. I love to learn about farming. Me and my cousin try making treehouses, campfires and a lot more. We watch constellations in the sky and have so much fun! I am a very fast swimmer and I do not fear deep waters at all. I love it and it is a very good sport to be honest with you.</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify"><font color="3FA03E">For those who are wondering how was my school life at this age, well it was too good. I was in EuroSchool and it had a swimming pool, and all sorts of fun stuff. In from 2nd grade, I always used to be in the class toppers list. Especially in 5th and 6th grade where I was a all time class topper with my percentage at 94%. Yeah, there are a few who get like 99% but I just consider myself smarter than them as I have knowledge in most science sectors. They just study a different way than me. But, they will never utilize that knowlwdge in things that they can use when they grow up. Anyways, having other toppers similar to you just means that you will be good friends with them unless they are rude or something. But they only know the things which they are taught in school but I love exploring more than them. At least in India, there are only a few who are curious like me. You know what? Most of the things I do, my parents have to barely spend money on them. All the things I do are basically made from trash or is just available at home. That reminds me of a saying "One man's trash is another man's treasure" which is so true for me. This actually saves the environment and the things are also reused!</font> </p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;">I am a huge animal lover. I feed milk to cats and feed a few dogs. My parents are not fancy with it still. Whenever I go to my farmhouse, I go feed the goats the 2 cows and play with the chickens. They are all very lovely. I love feeding monkeys when I go to hilly areas. Lets say I am an animal lover to a certain extent. I am not goin' and touching lizards or anything. I just love animals which are cute, harmless and love humans! I don't know why my sister is so afraid of cats. I LOVE CAT MEMES!!!!!</p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify"><font color="3FA03E">From an early age I used to write research papers where I used to write my scientific discoveries, theories, accidentally discoverd experiments, concepts and inventions. The research papers are very old so I seriously have no idea when I wrote them. They were so cool to see after a long time!</font></p>
<p style="font-size: 20px;" align="justify">I am a very good speaker in my school. I've participated in all elocution competitions and skits. I love making cool school PowerPoint presentaitons with my friends. I seriously love to compete with others and even if I lose I don't care because I do it for myself. After two months I will become 12 and then I am going to share so many things with you and do things that I could not in my childhood cuz my teenage will start. I can open social media and all sorts of that stuff! I will also share the names of a few of my very best friends.</p>
