<p>From age 6 I always crafted something. Even it was trash. It used to teach me something. Till age 8 I used to make these gadgets of science. My mom was tired of cleaning them up. I had made so many of them that I filled up a whole container that is used to fill up grains. It was 1 meter by 500 cm!</p>
<p>At age 10 I used to do thes experiments. I started off with chemistry. My father used to buy me these chemicals. He bought me hydrogen peroxide, potassium permanganate, copper sulphate, and sodium acetate. These were safe experiments but some used to be dangerous. Like making chlorine gas an hydrogen in my balcony.</p>
<p>When I used to get bored with chemistry, I used to do physics. I used to do these electrical experiments. I made robots, do experiments with nichrome wires (which my father bought), and so much more!</p>
<p> When I got bore wih physics, I used to do stargazing. I had this telescope (which my father bought for me). I used to look at the moon and look at the planets of the solar system through it. Boy it was fun!</p>
<p>You guessed it! When I got bored again, I used to mess around with technology. I used to break apart things that don't work and harvest working parts from them. I used to also make viruses with notepad in windows when I was at this age. I used to make virtual machines and experiment with operating systems from the time that I wasn't even born yet! I used to stress test computers and much more! I used to play retro games and get to know the history about them. I used to code my own games too! And I still make them today! I used to experiment with browsers and the list goes on till today!</p>
<p>Now I'm 11 years old. I made this website at this age. I have a video recorded of all the experiments i've done till now. I'm now in 7th grade. I did not even leave the field of rocket science. I used to make parachutes like a NASA engineer and throw then off the 7th floor of my building with some friends.</p>
<p>For those who are wondering why I left biology behind, I've recently started experimenting with this too! I made plant pots and terrairiums and observed the behaviour of insects such as ants. From age 9 a had photos of all creatures I saw. When I was in fourth grade I even saw a monkey sitting in my balcony. It is confusing to see a wild animal in a huge city.</p>
<p>I've always been fascinated with science and I continue to explore it! I want to become an astronaut when I grow up.</p>
<p>All this was possible only because of my parents and youtube. I have subscribed to some of my favourite youtubers. Here are their names. I want to give them credit for this</p>
<p>I get quite sad when I lose my videos whle transferring or when somebody deletes them. I put them together and edit them with hard work.</p>
